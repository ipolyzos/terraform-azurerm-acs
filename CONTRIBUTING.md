# Contributing

Feel free to put up a pull request to fix a bug or maybe add a feature.
I will give it a code review and make sure that it does not break backwards compatibility.
If contribution is in line with the vision of the project, I will work with you to get the code into a mergeable state and merge it into the master branch.
If you have contributed something significant to the project, I will most likely add you as a collaborator given the ability to merge others pull requests. 

**It is very important that new code does not break existing code, so be careful about what code you do choose to merge.**
